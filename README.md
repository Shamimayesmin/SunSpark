# ☀️ Solar-Shop – Frontend

Built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, this platform showcases solar products with modern UI features, dynamic visuals, and interactive tools.

> 🛠️ I contributed to the frontend development of this project as part of a collaborative team, focusing on building core UI features and integrating key functionalities..  
> ⚠️ Backend integration is currently disabled or mocked due to lack of `.env` files and backend API access.
